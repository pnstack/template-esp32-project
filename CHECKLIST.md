### Custom Features
- [ ] Identified features to add (sensors, actuators, etc.)
- [ ] Added required libraries to `platformio.ini`
- [ ] Created custom modules (if needed)
- [ ] Updated documentation for changes

## Documentation Review

### Read Documentation

- [ ] Read [README.md](README.md) for project overview
- [ ] Read [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) for detailed setup
- [ ] Read [docs/API.md](docs/API.md) for API documentation
- [ ] Read [docs/OTA_UPDATES.md](docs/OTA_UPDATES.md) for OTA guide
- [ ] Read [docs/EXAMPLES.md](docs/EXAMPLES.md) for code examples
- [ ] Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for system design
- [ ] Read [FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md](FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md) for file organization

## Development Workflow

### Version Control
- [ ] Git initialized (if starting fresh)
- [ ] Remote repository configured
- [ ] `.gitignore` working (credentials not tracked)
- [ ] Initial commit made
- [ ] Pushed to remote repository

### Build Process
- [ ] Familiar with PlatformIO commands
- [ ] Can build project: `pio run`
- [ ] Can upload firmware: `pio run --target upload`
